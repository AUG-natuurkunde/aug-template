# Exercise 6: Reuse content from another book

So far, you've been working inside your own book. But what if someone else has already written a page you’d like to reuse? Instead of copying it, you can **include it directly** into your own book using the [TeachBooks Recombiner](https://teachbooks.io/recombiner/).



\::::::{topic} Exercise objective
Can you include a page from someone else’s book into your own using the Recombiner?
\::::::


1. Open the [TeachBooks Recombiner](https://teachbooks.io/recombiner/).
2. Select the book and chapter(s) you want to reuse:

   * Click on the book (e.g., **TeachBooks Manual**).
   * Browse the chapters and click the `+` button to select the ones you want (e.g., **Collaboration in GitHub**).
3. Click **Show how do it yourself instructions**
4. Follow the instructions provided:

   * Copy the external link (it will look something like this):

     ```yaml
     - external: https://github.com/TeachBooks/manual/blob/v1.1.1/book/workflows/collaboration.md
     ```
   * Paste it into the `parts:` or `chapters:` section of your `_toc.yml` file in your book repository.
   * Save the changes, commit, and push them.

\::::::{admonition} Example: `_toc.yml` snippet

```yaml
format: jb-book
root: intro

chapters:
  - file: 001
  - external: https://github.com/TeachBooks/manual/blob/v1.1.1/book/workflows/collaboration.md
  - file: 003
```

\::::::

5. When you are ready, commit your changes to the repository by clicking on the green `Commit changes` button.

6. Add a commit message.

7. To see your changes, go to {octicon}`play` `Actions` - The most recent workflow run `overview.md / the commit message of the commit you just made` - Wait for it to finish - In the summary, click on the link of your book shown in the table `Branches deployed` and under `Primary book at root` (getting bored of waiting? There'll be exercising on doing this locally which prevents you from waiting).

8. Do you see your change? If you don't see it click `CTRL`+`F5`/`Control`+`F5`to refresh the page.



\::::::{admonition} Check your understanding
\:class: note

Before moving on, make sure you understand:

* What is the benefit of linking to an external page instead of copying it?
* How does using the Recombiner simplify adding external content?
