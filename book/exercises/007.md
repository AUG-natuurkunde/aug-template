# Exercise 6: Add your first content (File Structure)

Now that you've made your own version of the book, it's time to add some content. 

1. Navigate to the file you want to work in (for example `book/some_content/overview.md`) and make sure you're in the correct branch.

2. Let's create the structure of your chapter. You can start by adding a title to the section. The title is always defined in the first line of the file after the hashtag `#`. Then yo can also add sections and subsections as needed.

```
# Chapter Title (H1)
## Section Title (H2)
### Subsection Title (H3)
#### Smaller Heading (H4)
```

3. Add some text to the sections.

4. When you are ready, commit your changes to the remote repository by clicking on the green `Commit changes` button.

5. Add a commit message.

6. To see you changes, go to {octicon}`play;1em` `Actions` - The most recent workflow run `overview.md / the commit message of the commit you just made` - Wait for it to finish - In the summary, click on the link of your book shown in the table `Branches deployed` and under `Primary book at root` (getting bored of waiting? There'll be exercising on doing this locally which prevents you from waiting (user type 4))

7. Do you see your change? If you don't see it click `CTRL`+`F5`/`Control`+`F5`to refresh the page.
