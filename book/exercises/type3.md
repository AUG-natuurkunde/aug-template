# User Type 3

Now that you've made your own version of the book, it's time to add some content. As user type 3 you will work primarily in `.md` (Markdown) or `.ipynb`(Jupyter Notebook) files. In Jupyter Book, `.md` files contain text-based content with formatting, while ipynb` files contain both text and executable code cells. In this exercise you will learn how to structure a `.md` file. 

Exercises for user type 3 relate to:

- [File structure (Markdown)](007.md)
- [Adding visual media](008.md)
