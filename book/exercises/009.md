# Exercise 9: Referencing using target headers

It can be really useful to refer to a specific section in your book  while working in a different file. Referencing can be done using target headers such as:

```
(<title>)=
```

1. Navigate to the file you want to work in (for example `book/some_content/overview.md`) and make sure you're in the correct branch.

2. Identify the section you want to reference and name it between brackets for example `exercise_`1.

```
(exercise_1)=
# Exercise 1: First file edit

Let's start with the most basic edit: add some text to a file and see that the website is updated...

```

3. Referencing

There are three types of referencing:

* If you want to refernce in line you can use:

My favourite exercise was {ref}`exercise_1`.

```
My favourte exercise was {ref}`exercise_1`.
```
* You can also specify the in-line text of the target (aka what the link will say):

{ref}`Best exercise <exercise_1>`

* Another alternative is to use Markdown syntax:

[Best exercose](exercise_1)
