# Exercise 9: Referencing using target headers

It can be really useful to refer to a specific section in your book  while working in a different file. Referencing can be done using target headers. (<title>)=

1. Navigate to the file you want to work in (for example `book/some_content/overview.md`) and make sure you're in the correct branch.

2. Identify the section you want to reference and name it ebtween bracketsfor example exercise_1.

```
(exercise_1)=
# Exercise 1: First file edit

Let's start with the most basic edit: add some text to a file and see that the website is updated...

```

3. Referncing

There are three types of referencing

If you want to refernce in line you can use:

My favourte exercise was {ref}`exercise_1`.

```
My favourte exercise was {ref}`exercise_1`.
```
You can specify the text of the target:

{ref}`MyST syntax lecture <exercise_1>`

Another alternative is to use Markdown syntax:

[MyST syntax lecture](exercise_1)
