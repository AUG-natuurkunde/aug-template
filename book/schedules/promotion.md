ðŸŒŸ Exciting Announcement! ðŸŒŸ

Calling all structural design enthusiasts and educators! We're thrilled to share some fantastic news with you. This year marks the beginning of an exciting journey as we start on the process of updating the Quick Reference and 'Vademecum voor draagconstructies van gebouwen', your trusted companion in the bachelor and master.

Originally introduced in 2004 as "Info Map Constructieleer," the Quick Reference has been a cornerstone in the education of countless students, providing comprehensive guidance tailored to both bachelor and master levels. As we step into a new era of innovation and sustainability, it's time for the Quick Reference and the Vademecum to evolve.

Our team is hard at work to bring you a refreshed, up-to-date version that not only meets but exceeds your expectations. Get ready for an immersive learning experience as we introduce interactivity, incorporate cutting-edge topics like circularity and sustainability, and delve deeper into recent developments in structural design!

If youâ€™re interested to contribute to this project or have any suggestions, feel free to contact Roel Schipper. Stay tuned!

Teampartners; Roel Schipper, Sander Pasterkamp, Ate Snijder, Geert Ravenshorst, Marco Schuurman, Guus Meinema and Niels van Vliet.
